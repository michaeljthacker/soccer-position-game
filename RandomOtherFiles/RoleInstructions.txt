Goalie: Stay between the goal and the ball, never too far upfield. Be ready to block any direct threat.

Defender: Work with the goalie and fellow defender to protect the goal; maintain spacing and never let an opponent get behind you.

Midfielder: Move up and down the field, staying central and balancing support for both defense and attack.

Forward: Keep your spacing and be ready for a pass. If you're closest to the ball, go for it.
